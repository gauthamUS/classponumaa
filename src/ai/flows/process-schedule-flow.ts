    prompt: `You are an intelligent assistant for a university student. Your task is to determine the class schedule for a specific course based on a weekly timetable image and an academic calendar PDF.

    **Analysis Steps:**

    1.  **Analyze the Weekly Timetable for the Course:**
        *   Look for the specific course code '{{{courseCode}}}' inside green-colored boxes in the timetable image.
        *   For each green box that contains the course code, look at the very first column of that same row to identify the day of the week (e.g., MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI).
        *   List the full weekdays that have classes for this course. For example: If classes are on TUE, THU, FRI, the output should be ["Tuesday", "Thursday", "Friday"].

    2.  **Extract Non-Instructional Days from the Academic Calendar:**
        *   Scan the academic calendar PDF thoroughly.
        *   Identify all dates marked as "No instructional day", "Holiday", "Continuous Assessment Test - I", or "Continuous Assessment Test - II".
        *   **Important**: If any of these are specified as a date range (e.g., "September 10-15" or "October 2-4"), keep the range as is in the output. Do not expand it.
        *   Create a list of all these dates. For each entry, provide the date (or date range) and the specific reason (e.g., "Holiday", "CAT-I").

    3.  **Identify the Last Instructional Day:**
        *   Find the date specified as the "Last Instructional Day for theory classes" in the calendar.
        *   Return this date in the 'lastInstructionalDay' field.

    **Output Format:**

    *   Return a JSON object.
    *   In the 'classDays' array, provide the full names of the weekdays identified from the timetable.
    *   In the 'nonInstructionalDays' array, provide the list of dates/ranges and reasons you extracted.
    *   In the 'lastInstructionalDay' field, provide the date you found.
    *   In the 'reason' field, provide a brief summary of your findings, for example: "Based on the timetable, classes for {{{courseCode}}} are on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays."
    *   If you cannot determine the days, return an empty 'classDays' array and explain the issue in the 'reason' field.

    **Image and PDF Input:**

    Weekly Timetable: {{media url=weeklyTimetableDataUri}}
    Academic Calendar: {{media url=academicCalendarDataUri}}
    `,
